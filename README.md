<h1>About</h1>

This project was started at the request of Aideron Technologies CEO in 2013. This software is basically an advanced prototype.
Code beauty was not a priority, moreover this is not in objective PHP, just plain-old structural PHP.
I had plans to refactor entire project into CodeIgniter framework, but this plan is currently on hold.

For the most current version check the "Releases" page. The trunk code is unstable and is not recommended to run on production.
